# High-Dimensional Differential Parameter Inference in Exponential Family using Time Score Matching (AISTATS 2025)

## Current Folder

Code for reproducing SparTSM results:

- ```demo_fourier.ipynb```: Figure 1
- ```demo_ROC.ipynb```, ```demo_ROC_ratio.py```: Figure 2
- ```demo_senate.ipynb```: Figure 5

Requires python 3.10+ with ```torch```, ```panda```, ```networkx```, and ```matplotlib``` packages.  

## Folder Structure

Folder for reproducing debiased estimator (SparTSM+) results (Figure 3, 4)
```
debiased/
```
Please see README file in the folder for detailed procedures for reproducing the results. 


Folder for reproducing Loggle method reuslts
```
loggle/
```
Note that Loggle method was run and results were collected separately from the rest methods as it requires a special R environment.
